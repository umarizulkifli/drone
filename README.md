Drone is a Continuous Delivery system built on container technology. Drone uses a simple YAML configuration file, a superset of docker-compose, to define and execute Pipelines inside Docker containers.

Sample Pipeline Configuration:

    name: default

    kind: pipeline
    type: docker

    steps:
    - name: backend
    image: golang
    commands:
        - go get
        - go build
        - go test

    - name: frontend
    image: node:6
    commands:
        - npm install
        - npm test

    - name: publish
    image: plugins/docker
    settings:
        repo: octocat/hello-world
        tags: [ 1, 1.1, latest ]
        registry: index.docker.io

    - name: notify
    image: plugins/slack
    settings:
